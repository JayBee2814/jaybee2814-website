    <p>
      The goal here is to make a cyberpunk aesthetic peephole using a RPi Zero
      and camera module coupled with a tv to give a live feed of the view
      through my peephole. I've gone through a few iterations, and I am close to
      being to where I can call it "useable" but a finished state still eludes
      me.

      he has a fantastic channel where he restores and improves classic iPods.
      Since I'm apparently easily swayed by YouTube videos, I've decided to do
      the same to an iPod I purchased off eBay. Thankfully I bought one when I
      did because thanks to DankPods, the cost of secondhand iPods has
      skyrocketed recently. The goal is to have the iPod sit at either 500 GB or
      1TB. I haven't decided yet. I have a sizeable collection of FLAC files
      that are rather large so I'll have to decide if I want them
      <em>all</em> on the iPod.

    <p>
      Recently I was fortunate enough to come into possession of a 2nd
      Generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop. However the top shell is cracked and
      the screen may be damaged. I've also noticed some scuffs around the edges
      as if the device has been dropped. My plan is to procure a charger for the
      device and figure out how deep the damage really goes, then repair it.
      Thankfully it shouldn't be too difficult as long as I don't have to
      resolder any ridiculously tiny components or anything. The ThinkPad
      community online has fantastic resources for projects such as this.

      Last year my YouTube suggestions introduced me to the wonderful channel of

      who, doesn't post much, but the quality is great. Again, my impressionable
      self was convinced to begin modding my old consoles, and so far I've only
      done one mod but it was very satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first, and only, mod I've done was to add a Mayumi Mod Chip into my
      SCPH-7501 PS1 console. The solder isn't the cleanest but it works, and I'll
      probably revisit it down the road. I have planned though, for my other
      PS1, to add in an ODE and digital output mods for play on an HDTV without
      the need for something like an OSSC and discs. I also intend to do the
      same with my Dreamcast and possibly in the future a PS2.
