## Don't Get Me Wrong
I love living in my apartment. I've been in it since Feb of 2020 and have made a pretty solid little home out of it. I mean yea the kitchen is weirdly oriented and is a bit of a struggle to organize in a logical manner, and sure the living room isn't the easiest to work with when it comes to furniture placement in my opinion...oh and all the appliances suck.Hot tip, the clothes dryer in your home is usually the largest energy sink, mine adds a solid $15 to the electricity bill. But it does have a pretty nice study off the living room that I use as a man cave gaming center, and the bathroom is massive. As with anything theres pros and cons and up till now I've felt the pros have vastly outweighed the cons.

Until now.

## Oh Shit That Might Get Us Sick
About 2 months after I started dating my girlfriend, I was laying on the bed with her after she got up from a nap when I noticed an oddly large black shadow under the window sill. Without really saying anything I got up and layed on the floor to get a better look, and bam, mold. Mold all over that window. So much mold it was making the paint flake off the drywall. I poked it a bit and paint just fell off, I also put a minor amount of weight on the window sill and it rocked, was the wood starting to rot?

My girlfriend and I were pissed. How could mold just show up out of nowhere like that? I went back to the window and noticed water stains...shit there was a leak. Ok well we'll just call maintenance and they'll come by and fix it right? 

Wrong.

It took a solid month before someone even stepped foot in the apartment. And they only came by because we called every. single. day. It wasn't even the person who *should* be doing that, it was the front desk guy cleaning the mold off with bleach. It took maybe another 2 weeks after that before I was told "You'll have someone by today to come look at the leak". Good. An hour passed when I got another call saying their key wasn't working, can I let them in? I ran home from work, and sat at that apartment for 3 hours before calling the front office. They claimed that the repair crew had already been by for my roof issue.

"*Roof issue?!*"

No no no ma'am. I have a leaking window on the first floor. "Oh...well that is different." No shit. She asked what unit I was in, and came by to double check that the key worked, which it did and said they'll send people right over. The fuck dude. By this time I really HAD to get back to work so I told them that and raced back to the store.

I came home to the smell of caulk and sealant. Ok so they fixed the window....but they didn't paint it?

In late September we heard a knock at the door and it was the maintenance guy asking if he could look at the window. We let him in and he said "yea I'll be by to paint this and fix it up."

It's Oct 15 and he still hasn't been by.

## And Now The Ants
As part of my rent, I pay 25 bucks a month for bi-weekly pest control. I'm pretty sure they've been slacking. Mid Sept we noticed a ton of ants on the patio, crawling all over our new furniture. Ok well they're outside so that's ok for now. Let's just put out some diatomaceous earth and keep them away. It kind of worked. But now within the past few days we've noticed an unholy amount of ants in both the bathroom and kitchen. Problem is, I'm pretty sure they're the crazy ants that end up ruining electronics when they make a nest in your shit. 

I've put in a call to have extra pest control...we'll see if it works.

## All The Other Shit
I called the police for the first time last month. I'm 99% certain my upstairs neighbor was in the midst of a domestic disturbance when we called. Nothing came of it but it was a wild night to be sure. 

Oh and the other neighbor that just lets his dog piss on the concrete where it bakes in the hot Texas sun and makes everything smell like burnt urine. That's always fun.

Oh and lest we forget the parking situation. Half the spaces are unused covered parking because they charge too much, so everyone else has to battle royale for the free spots.

I need a house.
