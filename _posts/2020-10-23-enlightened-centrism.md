## This one will be short.
Hearing the phrase "Different Sides of the Same Coin" or "Both Side are the Same" triggers me something fierce when it pertains to politics. Honestly anybody that say's it, to me, immediately outs themselves as being wholly ignorant to the differences between the political parties of the US, *especially* after the events of the past 4 years. To sit there and say that with your chest, to act like there is any form of equivalence between the American Left and Right, takes an immense amount of privilege and ignorance.
