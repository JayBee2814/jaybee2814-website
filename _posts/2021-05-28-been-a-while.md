### Well Hot Damn
Alright so it's been a while since my last foray into DMing a campaign for D&D but I think I'm about to do it again. Sophia and her friends seem to be interested in running a story with me as the DM.

My current plan is, run a one shot to see how everyone prefers to play, whether that be more RP heavy, combat focused, a healthy mix etc, etc. With that being said, since I think every single one of them is related to the theater world, I think this will end up being a very RP heavy game. I'm more concerned with how they feel with an open ended game versus something that pushes them to follow a plot. 

With the questions that Sophia asked on the ride home from my game with Will and his campaign, I think she'll want something more railroad-y, but if she has a solid jumping off point, she might be able to roll with a fluid campaign structure.

### Any Story Ideas?
So currently I don't have anything worked out. I've had a general idea for a game where it interprets the general plot structure of The Broken Bride rock opera by Ludo. 

Essentially it's a time travel plot where a scientist... or in this case a Wizard/Sorcerer... wants to travel into the past to try and save his wife from a deadly accident. So with that being said, the group would for some reason be compelled to travel back either for or with the Wizard/Sorcerer to help save her.

However, this is where the plot gets weird. Since time travel is such an imprecise magic, they over shoot and go back way to far in the past. Where they'll be trapped in a sort of jungle with dinosaurs and other vicious creatures. I think I'll have to add a settlement of sorts to help them have contact with somebody. Maybe even have it be an ancient civilization that has been long forgotten due to some calamity. An Atlantis story of sorts even?

I think that arc could easily take them to level 5 or 10 even if it's long enough. All this being said, this is if I even make the campaign from scratch. I could just as easily run a story that has been written by the people at WotC and have more of a structure ready for me.

I could even start with something pre-written, use the time savings from that to prep the time travel arc. Makes sense right? I think it could work. Just depends on if the group wants to actually run a long form campaign or if they enjoy the more episodic nature of one shots. Either way is fine with me.
