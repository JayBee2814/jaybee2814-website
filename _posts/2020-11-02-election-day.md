### It's Finally Here
4 long years and it's finally here. 4 years of Trumpism and its ilk running the show. 4 years of Americas worst showing it's face. 4 years of depression and anger. And it could all be over tonight. 

The numbers look good for Joe. They look really good, and each new story about early vote breakdown make them look even better. Hopefully that carries him to an early win tonight so I can begin the process of decompressing and return to my healthy self. Like, I've lost friends over this stuff. I've lost family (not that I ever really considered them family but it sounds more dramatic), and theres a chance that I could wake up tomorrow vindicated and refreshed. 

Only time will tell, but the future looks bright. I might have to wear some aviator shades.
