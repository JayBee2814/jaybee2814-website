## It's Finally Here
4 long years and it's finally here. 4 years of Trumpism and its ilk running the show. 4 years of Americas worst showing it's face. 4 years of depression and anger. And it could all be over tonight. 

The numbers look good for Joe. They look really good, and each new story about early vote breakdown make them look even better. Hopefully that carries him to an early win tonight so I can begin the process of decompressing and return to my healthy self. Like, I've lost friends over this stuff. I've lost family (not that I ever really considered them family but it sounds more dramatic), and theres a chance that I could wake up tomorrow vindicated and refreshed. 

Only time will tell, but the future looks bright. I might have to wear some aviator shades.

## Update
So election...week... has come and past. I'll admit, on tuesday night I was feeling a little nervous. The Red Mirage got to me. However by around midday wednesday I was feeling much more confident. The remaining mail-in ballots were all from heavily Dem favored areas, and the Dem mail-in turnout in every county was higher. By Thursday I knew it was over and that Joe would be officially declared eventually, I didn't realize it would take until that saturday for the networks to make the call. 

I have to say though, getting that news update, even though I knew it was coming was a massive relief. Like a weight had been lifted. I spent most of that day in a sort of high, wearing my Biden/Harris shirt and smiling at other supporters. That whole weekend was just a good time for all of us. My more conservative leaning friends were oddly silent though. I think Chris didn't even vote, and Eric seems like the type to vote for Trump, but I have no idea how they actually feel about the outcome. Maybe they're waiting for the "legal challenges" to be finalized and lead to...nowhere.

Fights not over yet though, Georgia still has 2 senate seat runoffs and those 2 seats determine control of the senate.
