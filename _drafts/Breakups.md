## It fucking really fucking sucks a lot.
Friend breakups are weird. You know you're supposed to get upset when someone dies, or your romantic partner decides it just isn't working out anymore. But nothing really prepares you for that feeling of a friendship ending.\
It's been eating at me in the pit of my stomache for a hot minute now. For maybe 2 months...possibly 3, I've been watching a close friendship end in slow motion. Ostensibly because of a simple breakdown in communication, but I feel it's something else entirely.\
I'm not going to go into escruciating detail but I'll lay out the basic facts, step by step,

### Background
Some context is needed before I go into it.\
My friend is the type of person to want to talk about personal things and emotional problems with their close peers. They also try to get you to really open up to them as well. I should say, in full disclosure, I'm not the best at emotional discussions and usually relate to problems in a more logical point of view. I prefer to slice an issue up into its baser parts and find a solution myself though reasoning it out like some sort of puzzle. I have a bad habit of applying this form of problem solving to other people when they come to me, and it can sometimes cause friction. Remember that fact.\
My friend, who shall remain nameless and genderless, is also an artist. Their calling in life is to create and share. That can range from beautiful fanart of major motion pictures, to meticulously thought out runs of merchandise. However the world of art doesnt run on praise and exposure, it requires money. Money that, for this person was mainly made at conventions and online leveraging overseas manufacturers.\
Covid brought all of that to a screeching halt.\
Their entire world was thrown into disarray almost overnight. Their state was one of the first to have a major outbreak, and as such, if I remmeber correctly, was one of the first to shutdown. This of course means conventions were out of the question. Well since the virus also originated overseas, there was no guarantees their manufacturers would keep their doors open or keep prices low.\
Obviously this sort of turmoil can have the nasty side effect of showing someone how little they actually control in their life. People can react to this veil of agency lifting in different ways.
As a final bit of background, we hared a Discord server with some other friends. I can go into the details of that arrangement later, all you need to know for now is that Discord is where a majority of our conversations took place over voice and text.

### A Pandemic...of Lost Mail
As time went on, things got worse. Mental states began to fray. People being locked inside, left to their own devices will start to go a little mad.\
All things considered though my friend held up well...at first. When it was just the pandemic being an issue, there were still some work arounds to their issues.
The outbreak had hit them hard, but they still had the shipping side of their business and could hold onto that last bit of hope.\
Then Louis DeJoy started talking about his proposed changes.\
That was when the true despair started to set in. The light at the end of the tunnel for them became more and more dim. Anything you said to try and lift their spirits was met with quick and decisive rebuttle.\
I tried. I need to say that here and now. I tried my best to make them feel better, to tell them it was temporary and that everyone was in the same boat. Every single time though, it fell on deaf ears. Or rather, it fell on increasingly hostile ears.\

## Shot Able
The first blowup occured several weeks ago. I'd love to tell you an exact date but due to future events that isn't a possibility.\
It all began with them commenting in the group Discord something along the lines of "The USPS going down will ruin me". So, even though I was already on eggshells, offered some words of commiseration and hope. Hope apparently, is some sort of toxic substance to them. Because you see, it went from bad to immediatly worse. I can't offer the full text of what was said, but essentially, they claimed that absolutely nothing could be done and that it was a lost cause. I, being the
