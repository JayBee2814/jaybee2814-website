            Cooking
        </p>
        <p>
            Cooking and being in the kitchen is a passion of mine. Given the chance, I'll cook for myself or other people 99 times out of 100. 
            My favorite cuisines to work with are Italian and Japanese, however I also greatly enjoy to make a variety of dishes from the African and European Continents.

            Gunpla
        </p>
        <p>
            Gunpla, or Gundam Plastic Models, is the art of building and customizing the various model kits of the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise as produced by Bandai.
            It's a deeply rewarding hobby that flexes your creativity and hand eye coordination.
            In my spare time I can sometimes be found building new kits, trying to design custom color schemes for them or planning out dioramas. Currently I have 2 display cases full of kits,
            and will almost certainly be adding a third case fairly soon.

            Computers
        </p>
        <p>
            If I'm not making something to eat or working on a plastic model kit, I'll be found working on the various computer systems in my apartment. These include my Pi 4 powered Plex server,
            my PiZero W powered peephole camera, a Pi 4 powered Home Assistant build (which I have yet to finish the automations for), my Streaming/HTPC and my personal rig.

            My personal PC is a Ship of Theseus paradox, currently its specs are as follows:

          Video Games
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might be able to tell from the specs of my personal PC, I enjoy to play video games as well. Normally I play on Steam with friends*, but occaisionally I'll play
        games on PS4 and Xbox for the exclusives. Bloodborne and Demon's Souls yo.
      </p>
      <p>*So all my friends are either super friggin busy now with their opwn lives (which I can't get mad at, you do you boo) or just don't play games anymore (cowards).</p>
