        <p>Currently I work as the President of <a href="https://www.bayneworks.com/">Bayne HomeWorks</a> in Southern Texas. As part of that, I handle inventory management as well as a majority of the accounting.
        That being said, I spend 90% of my work day either in QuickBooks, or looking at the Online Banking feeds. </p>

        <p>I also have used my past experience in other fields to manage the entire IT infrasturcture of the store, including the management of the local server, and all deployments of 
        employee PC's for day to day work. That also includes doing activities like running and terminating CAT-5e cable across the entire building.</p>

            Cooking
        </p>
        <p>
            Cooking and being in the kitchen is a passion of mine. Given the chance, I'll cook for myself or other people 99 times out of 100. 
            My favorite cuisines to work with are Italian and Japanese, however I also greatly enjoy to make a variety of dishes from the African and European Continents.

            Gunpla
        </p>
        <p>
            Gunpla, or Gundam Plastic Models, is the art of building and customizing the various model kits of the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise as produced by Bandai.
            It's a deeply rewarding hobby that flexes your creativity and hand eye coordination.
            In my spare time I can sometimes be found building new kits, trying to design custom color schemes for them or planning out dioramas. Currently I have 2 display cases full of kits,
            and will almost certainly be adding a third case fairly soon.

            Computers
        </p>
        <p>
            If I'm not making something to eat or working on a plastic model kit, I'll be found working on the various computer systems in my apartment. These include my Pi 4 powered Plex server,
            my PiZero W powered peephole camera, a Pi 4 powered Home Assistant build (which I have yet to finish the automations for), my Streaming/HTPC and my personal rig.

          Video Games
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might be able to tell from the specs of my personal PC, I enjoy to play video games as well. Normally I play on Steam with friends, but occaisionally I'll play
        games on PS4 and Xbox for the exclusives.
